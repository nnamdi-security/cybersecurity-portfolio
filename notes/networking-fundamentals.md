# Neworking Fundamentals
- The OSI model is a standard of the international organization for standardization(ISO)
- It is a general-purpose framework that characterises and standardises how computers communicate with one another over a network
- It is a seven-layered approach to data transmission which divides the operations into specific related groups of actions at each layer
- TCP/IP is a protocol stack which consists of multiple protocols including TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) and IP(Internet Protocol).
- TCP/IP is the main protocol stack used in computer operations today
- Whereas the OSI reference model is conceptual, the TCP/IP stack is used to transfer data in production networks.
- TCP/IP is also layered but does not use all of the OSI layers, though the layers are equivalent in operation and function.
